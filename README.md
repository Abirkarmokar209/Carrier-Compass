# CareerCompass

A personalized career planning platform that helps you plan, follow, and
track a learning roadmap for the career you want — built as a full-stack
JavaScript app (React + Node/Express).

> Plan your career like a trail — one waypoint at a time.

## Features

- **Public home page** — explains what the platform does before you sign in.
- **Accounts** — register/login with JWT-based sessions.
- **Profile creation & editing** — headline, bio, location, interests, and a skill base with levels.
- **Roadmaps, three ways**
  - **Build your own** — add waypoints from scratch.
  - **Follow a curated roadmap** — Cybersecurity Analyst, Data Analyst, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer guides included.
  - **Customize a roadmap** — clone a curated guide onto your profile and edit it freely.
- **Daily progress tracking** — leave a short note + a % done for any waypoint, any day.
- **Dashboard** — streaks, overall completion, and a skill profile built automatically from your activity.
- **Trail visualization** — a signature winding-trail SVG connects each roadmap's waypoints.

## Tech stack

| Layer     | Tech                                                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React 18, React Router, Vite, plain CSS (design-token system)     |
| Backend   | Node.js, Express                                                   |
| Auth      | JWT (jsonwebtoken) + bcrypt password hashing                      |
| Storage   | Structured JSON-file datastore (`backend/src/utils/db.js`) — swap for MongoDB/Postgres later without touching controllers |

## Getting started

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # already copied — edit JWT_SECRET before deploying
npm run dev                # starts on http://localhost:5000
```

The first boot seeds four curated roadmap templates into `src/data/db.json`
automatically (see `src/seed/seedRoadmaps.js`).

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # points at http://localhost:5000/api by default
npm run dev                 # starts on http://localhost:5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — the Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the
backend, so both must be running.

### 3. Try the flow

1. Register an account → you're taken to your profile.
2. Fill in a headline and a couple of skills, save.
3. Go to **Explore**, follow a curated roadmap (or customize one), or build your own from **+ New roadmap**.
4. Open the roadmap, expand a waypoint, log today's progress with a note and a %, mark it complete when done.
5. Check **Dashboard** — your streak, overall %, and skill profile update automatically.
